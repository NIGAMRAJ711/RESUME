I'm a project-oriented engineering graduate with hands-on experience in deep learning and machine learning applications in healthcare. I have earned state and district-level awards for leadership through Scouts, where I developed strong team-building and survival skills. Passionate about AI, web development, and continuous learning, I've also completed certifications in JavaScript, AI, and software engineering. I enjoy blending technology and leadership to solve real-world problems.
